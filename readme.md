BorCodes (Bot Barcodes = bo rcodes)<br>

Description: This bot can decode one or an array of barcodes of different types into one QR code. It is also possible to create a code based on the entered text.<br><br>
This is my first bot and my first work in Python. I needed the bot for work in production and it copes with the task set for it quite well. In the first version I used the library "barcodes", but eventually abandoned it and started using the library "qrcode" to create codes, and for decoding: pylibdmtx and pyzbar.<br>
